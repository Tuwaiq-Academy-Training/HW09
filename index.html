    We have been trying French onion soup in resaurants for years and my family<br>
    and friends agree none can compare to my recipe for taste and simplicity of<br> preparation.</p>

 <h2>HOW TO CARAMELIZE ONIONS:</h2>
 <ol>
 <h6>
    <li>The first step to making traditional French onion soup is to transform that big pile of raw onions into the decadent,
    sweet, and irresistibly caramelized onions that will form the rich base of this recipe.</li>
   <li>Caramelization is actually a really simple process, but it does take some time. </li>
    <li>So turn some music on, maybe pour yourself an extra glass of that white wine we will be using,
      and get ready to spend some quality time by the stove as we work some onion magic.</li>
    <li>To make the caramelized onions, simply melt the butter in a large stockpot over medium heat.
       Add your onions, and toss so that they are coated in the butter. </li>
   <li>Let them cook for about 5 minutes, until they start to turn a bit golden on the bottom,
      and then give them a stir.</li>
      <li>Repeat for another 5 more minutes,
       then give them another good stir. </li>
      <li> Then continue this rhythm — stirring the onions every 3-5 minutes or so initially, 
       then every 1-2 minutes near the end — until the onions have caramelized into a rich
        chestnut brown color. (Anytime the onions look like they are starting to burn on the
         bottom of the pan, just add in a splash of wine or water and use a wooden spoon to
          scrape up those browned bits on the bottom of the pan.)  Then stir in a half cup
           of wine to fully deglaze the bottom of the pan once the onions are ready to go.</li></h6>
